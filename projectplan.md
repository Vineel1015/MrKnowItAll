- [ ] Store description and screenshots prepared
- [ ] Privacy policy created
- [ ] Extension packaged for distribution
- [ ] All Chrome Web Store requirements met

**Deliverables:**

## Technical Specifications

### Required Files Structure:

```

├── manifest.json
├── popup.html
├── popup.css
├── popup.js
├── background.js
├── goals-data.js

### Key Technologies:

- **HTML5/CSS3:** For UI and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For logic and interactions
- **Chrome Extension APIs:** For browser integration
- **Local Storage:** For data persistence
- **CSS Animations/Keyframes:** For 8-ball physics

### Performance Targets:

- Extension loads in < 500ms
- Shake animation completes in 2-3 seconds
- Memory usage under 10MB
- No blocking of Chrome startup

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria:

- Extension installs and runs without errors
- 8-ball shake produces random daily goal
- Visual design is engaging and professional
- Core functionality works reliably

### Overall Project Success:

- User can get a new goal each day
- Interface is intuitive and enjoyable to use
- Extension enhances rather than disrupts workflow
- Ready for Chrome Web Store submission

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with Chrome extension developer tools
2. Create basic project structure and manifest.json
3. Begin with Step 1: Project Setup & Foundation
4. Test frequently in Chrome Developer Mode during development
5. Keep user experience simple and focused on core 8-ball interaction

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with simple animations, enhance gradually
- Test across different screen sizes early
- Keep goal database curated for quality
- Plan for Chrome extension policy compliance
- Regular backup of code and assets
